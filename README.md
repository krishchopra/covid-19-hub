# COVID-19 Hub
An accessible voice application providing relevant information on COVID-19, including current statistics, tweets, news articles, and even advice on symptoms. You can find the DevPost [here](https://devpost.com/software/covid-19-hub-ge9fy4) and a video demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ridyufjahc).

Just for fun, here's a prototyped diagram of the conversational flow of our application.
